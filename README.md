# Game of Drones

This project tries to emulate the game "Rock-Paper-Scissors".

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install to run the game:

* Node.js
* Node Package Manager (npm)
* MongoDB

### Installing

This installation process assumes you already have MongoDB running as a daemon.

First, run

```
npm install && node server.js
```

inside the project folder

Then, on a separate terminal, run

```
npm install && npm start
```

inside the folder '/client'
